# calculator

I made a calculator that can do basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)

It also:

1) Rounds out numbers that go beyond the scope of the display
2) A clear function that clears out the display and all data
3) A Delete function that deletes the last selected digit

**FUNCTIONALITY YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED:
1) Keyboard Controls
